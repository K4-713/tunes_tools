iTunes library toy. CLI, hackjob. Enjoy in good health.

Structure notes:
See the attached sample xml

I have just gotten to the point where I read the library and stuff info I 
personally care about into a php array for easier processing.

Fun stuff I want to do next:
    * Genre counter
    * Artist list
    * Artists I basically hate (no songs over two stars, sorted by song count)
    * Best and worst skip-to-play ratios (artists, songs, albums)
	* Hehe playlist generator for the best ratios
    * Some concept of favorite album... rating+playcount based
